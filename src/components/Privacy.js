        We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on
        the Public Area of the Site, and create user navigation reports for our
        Site administrators. Google operates independently from us and has its

        App access to your Google data, the App's use of that data will be
        subject to these additional restrictions: The App will only use access
        to read, write, modify or control Gmail message bodies (including
        attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email
        client that allows users to compose, send, read,and process emails and
        will not transfer this Gmail data to others unless doing so is necessary
        to provide and improve these features, comply with applicable law, or as
        part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. The App will not use
        this Gmail data for serving advertisements. The App will not allow
        humans to read this data unless we have your affirmative agreement for
